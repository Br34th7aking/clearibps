3. Finished the login script.
4. Finished signup script. 
5. Added logout script. 
6. populated the index page with categories and added some css.
7. added the categories. picked to do it without php because a. categories in html will be handled by the browser. b. it seemed easier to do this way
8. added some css. now the categories and topics are looking good. 
9. added an admin page. now the 'admin' user is taken to a separate dashboard. He/She can add questions from here. 
10. note: in the current setup, when admin enters a question, he should also enter the solution in the solutions table. questionId and solutionId should match.

11. Adding questions is now working. Making the commit and going to bed...

-------------
1. used a form and added buttons to the topic list. Now when the user clicks the button, it's value will be passed to test.php 
   the values are taken as integers, so going to add a file with topic id and topic name.

1.5 Now test.php knows which button was clicked. So, the topic list is clear.
